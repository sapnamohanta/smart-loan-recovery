Got it Sapna 🙌 — let’s make your README more attractive, visually appealing, and structured so it really stands out for the jury. I’ll add emojis, headers, visual dividers, and callout styles so each section is clearly bifurcated and memorable.

💡 Smart Loan Recovery

Author: Sapna Mohanta
📌 Case Study Submission – TVS Credit EPIC

🔍 Problem Understanding

NBFCs often struggle with inefficient loan collection methods, leading to:

❌ Poor recovery rates

😟 Customer dissatisfaction

⏳ Manual, time-consuming processes

👉 The goal: Leverage AI, Data Science & Automation to improve collections by:

Predicting repayment risk.

Designing personalized recovery strategies.

Automating empathetic customer engagement.

🚀 Approach (3-Part Solution)
1️⃣ Predictive Model

📊 Simulated ML model (JavaScript) assigns a Risk Score per customer using behavioral + transactional features.

2️⃣ Strategy Engine

⚙️ Recommends tailored collection strategies (friendly reminder → strong call-to-action).

3️⃣ Persona-Based Chatbot

🤖 Powered by Gemini API, the chatbot:

Adapts tone dynamically to customer persona.

Generates draft communication.

Suggests flexible repayment plans.

💻 A full-stack demo (browser-based) makes this portable & interactive.

🛠️ Technology Stack
🎨 Frontend

🏗️ HTML → Webpage structure.

🎯 Tailwind CSS → Clean, responsive UI design.

⚡ JavaScript → Frontend logic & interactivity.

📈 Chart.js → Risk distribution visualization.

🖼️ Phosphor Icons → Intuitive, modern icons.

🤖 Backend / ML Simulation

🧮 Simulated ML Model (JS) → Risk scoring engine.

🧠 Gemini API → LLM-powered chatbot + strategic engagement.

🔮 (Production-ready upgrade → Python ML stack: Scikit-learn/XGBoost)

🎯 Expected Benefits

✨ Operational Efficiency → Automates repetitive agent tasks (up to 30% workload reduction).
📈 Increased Recovery Rate → Focuses resources on high-risk borrowers.
😊 Enhanced Customer Experience → Empathetic, persona-driven engagement reduces friction.

📊 Evaluation Metric

🎯 AUC-ROC (Area Under Curve – Receiver Operating Characteristic)

Best suited for imbalanced datasets.

Ensures reliable separation of defaulters vs. payers.

✨ Why this project is different?

🔹 Combines Predictive ML + Strategy Engine + AI Chatbot in one system.

🔹 Bridges business needs + customer empathy.

🔹 Presented as a realistic, full-stack demo (not just code).ficiency in collections through automation.

Higher recovery rates using targeted, data-driven strategies.

Better customer experience via empathetic, persona-based engagement.

📊 Evaluation Metric

AUC-ROC → Selected as the primary evaluation metric, since it handles imbalanced datasets well and shows how effectively the model differentiates between likely defaulters vs. payers.
